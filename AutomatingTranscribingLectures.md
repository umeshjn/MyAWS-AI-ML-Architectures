## Automating the transcribing of the lectures

I am not sure if this is the problem in every school and college around the world but at least in India, taking notes when the lecturer or professor or teacher is teaching is one of the very common thing which almost every student does or expected to do.

Problem with this approach is most of the times students do not really get to listen to lectures fully because half the time they are busy taking down the notes.

In this world of Artifical Intelligence, do we really need to do this manually and miss out the most important part - "The Lecture".

Below is one of the approach which we can employ to automate this and make the lectures transcription available to the students at any time. 

They can read them anytime and anywhere.
